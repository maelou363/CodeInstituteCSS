  <p>
      Block level elements take the whole horizontal space, stretching from left to right. They begin on a new line, which means no other elements can be placed next to them. Block-level elements, unlike inline elements, can have set properties for the size. width and height set the width and height dimensions for the element. max-width sets the maximum width for an element. It means that the width of the element cannot be higher than the value set by this property. max-height works similarly for the height of the element. min-width sets the minimum width for an element.
  </p>
  <p>
      The width of the element can't be less than the value set by this property. min-height behaves similarly for the height of the element. There are many block level elements in HTML. They are easy to recognize because they stretch from left to right across the page.
